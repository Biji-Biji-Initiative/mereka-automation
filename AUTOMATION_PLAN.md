## 📊 Test Execution Strategy

### Weekly Regression Tests
```yaml
Schedule: Every Monday at 9 AM UTC
Scope: Full test suite
Browsers: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
Environment: Staging
Parallel Workers: 5
Timeout: 60 minutes
```

### Post-Deployment Tests
```yaml
Trigger: After deployment to any environment
Scope: Smoke tests + Critical path tests
Browsers: Chromium (primary)
Environment: Matching deployment environment
Parallel Workers: 3
Timeout: 30 minutes
```

### Pull Request Tests
```yaml
Trigger: On PR creation/update
Scope: Changed functionality tests
Browsers: Chromium
Environment: Dev
Parallel Workers: 2
Timeout: 20 minutes
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Test Execution Time**: Monitor for performance degradation
- **Test Stability**: Track flaky test rates
- **Coverage**: Ensure adequate test coverage
- **Failure Rate**: Monitor overall test health

### Maintenance Schedule
- **Daily**: Review failed test reports
- **Weekly**: Update test data and configurations
- **Monthly**: Review test suite performance
- **Quarterly**: Audit and optimize test coverage

## 🚨 Incident Response

### When Tests Fail
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Check if it's a test issue or application issue
   - Verify environment health
   - Check for recent changes

2. **Investigation Process**
   - Analyze test artifacts (screenshots, videos, logs)
   - Check application logs
   - Verify test environment configuration

3. **Resolution Steps**
   - Fix application issues or update tests
   - Re-run affected tests
   - Document lessons learned

## 💰 Cost Considerations

### GitHub Actions (Estimated Monthly)
- **Public Repos**: Free
- **Private Repos**: $0.008/minute (2000 minutes free)
- **Estimated Monthly**: $20-50 for medium usage

### Jenkins (Self-hosted)
- **Infrastructure**: $50-200/month
- **Maintenance**: 4-8 hours/week
- **Total**: $300-500/month (including time)

### Azure DevOps
