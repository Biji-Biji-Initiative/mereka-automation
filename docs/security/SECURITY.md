# üîê Security Guidelines for Enhanced AI Bug Router

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented to protect sensitive API keys and ensure safe operation of the Enhanced AI Bug Router system.

## üõ°Ô∏è GitHub Secrets Management

### Required Secrets
The following secrets must be configured in your GitHub repository (`Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions`):

| Secret Name | Description | Example Format | Security Level |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key for AI classification | `sk-...` | **CRITICAL** |
| `CLICKUP_TOKEN` | ClickUp API token for task management | `pk_...` | **HIGH** |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | Slack bot token for notifications | `xoxb-...` | **HIGH** |

### Security Best Practices Implemented

#### ‚úÖ **GitHub Secrets Protection**
- All sensitive tokens stored as GitHub repository secrets
- Secrets automatically masked in workflow logs
- No hardcoded tokens in any source files
- Environment variables only available during workflow execution

#### ‚úÖ **Access Control**
- Secrets only accessible to repository collaborators
- Workflow permissions limited to required scopes only
- Repository-level access controls enforce team boundaries

#### ‚úÖ **Automated Security Validation**
- Pre-execution security scan checks for hardcoded secrets
- Workflow fails if any tokens found in source code
- Pattern matching detects common token formats

#### ‚úÖ **Audit Trail**
- GitHub logs all secret access and modifications
- Workflow execution logs provide deployment history
- Failed deployments automatically logged for investigation

## üîç Security Validation Process

### Automated Checks
Every workflow run includes:

1. **Secret Detection Scan**: Searches for hardcoded API keys
2. **Pattern Validation**: Checks for common token formats
3. **Configuration Verification**: Ensures proper secret mapping
4. **Health Check**: Validates API connectivity without exposing credentials

### Manual Security Review
Before deployment, verify:

- [ ] All API keys stored as GitHub secrets (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Secret names match workflow environment variables
- [ ] No sensitive data in commit history
- [ ] Proper access permissions on repository

## üö® Security Incident Response

### If Secrets Are Compromised:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Revoke compromised API keys immediately
   - Update GitHub secrets with new keys
   - Review recent workflow logs for unauthorized access

2. **Investigation**:
   - Check commit history for accidental token commits
   - Review repository access logs
   - Verify current collaborator permissions

3. **Recovery**:
   - Generate new API keys from service providers
   - Update GitHub repository secrets
   - Test workflow execution with new credentials

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warnings

### **NEVER** do the following:
- ‚ùå Hardcode API keys in source files
- ‚ùå Commit `.env` files with real credentials
- ‚ùå Share secrets in pull request descriptions
- ‚ùå Log secret values for debugging
- ‚ùå Use secrets in public repositories

### **ALWAYS** do the following:
- ‚úÖ Use GitHub secrets for all sensitive data
- ‚úÖ Use placeholder values in documentation
- ‚úÖ Regularly rotate API keys
- ‚úÖ Monitor workflow logs for unusual activity
- ‚úÖ Keep repository access permissions minimal

## üîß Emergency Procedures

### Suspected Security Breach
1. Immediately disable the GitHub workflow
2. Revoke all API keys from service providers
3. Review and audit all recent activity
4. Update security credentials
5. Re-enable workflow after verification

### Key Rotation Schedule
- **OpenAI API Keys**: Rotate every 6 months
- **ClickUp Tokens**: Rotate every 6 months  
- **Slack Bot Tokens**: Rotate annually or when team changes

## üìû Security Contacts

For security-related issues:
- Repository administrators have access to manage secrets
- Service provider support for API key issues
- GitHub support for platform security concerns

## üîÑ Security Updates

This document should be reviewed and updated:
- When new secrets are added
- After security incidents
- Every 6 months as part of security review
- When team membership changes significantly
