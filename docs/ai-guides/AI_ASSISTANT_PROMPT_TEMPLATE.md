## 🚀 MCP Integration Setup Request

I need help setting up **Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers** for **ClickUp** and **Slack** integration with **Cursor IDE**. I want to create AI-powered workflow automation where I can create tasks and send messages through natural language commands.

### 🎯 **What I Want to Achieve:**
- Create ClickUp tasks using AI commands (e.g., "Create a bug report task for login issue")
- Send Slack messages to specific channels automatically
- Combine both tools for automated project management workflows
- Have the MCP tools available directly in Cursor IDE chat

### 🔧 **My Current Setup:**
- **IDE:** Cursor IDE (latest version)
- **OS:** [Windows/Mac/Linux] - *replace with your OS*
- **Node.js:** [version] - *check with `node --version`*
- **Project Type:** [TypeScript/JavaScript/Other] - *specify your project*

### 📋 **Accounts & Access I Have:**
- **ClickUp Account:** ✅ Yes / ❌ Need to create
- **ClickUp Admin Access:** ✅ Yes / ❌ Limited
- **Slack Workspace:** ✅ Yes / ❌ Need access
- **Slack Admin Permissions:** ✅ Yes / ❌ Limited

### 🎯 **Specific Help I Need:**

#### 1. **Complete Step-by-Step Guide**
Please provide a comprehensive guide that includes:
- How to get ClickUp API tokens and find Team/List IDs
- How to create a Slack app with proper permissions
- How to configure the `.cursor/mcp.json` file correctly
- How to test the setup to ensure everything works

#### 2. **Working Code Examples**
I need actual code examples for:
- Testing ClickUp API connection
- Testing Slack API connection
- Creating a sample task in ClickUp
- Sending a test message to Slack
- Finding ClickUp List IDs and Slack Channel IDs

#### 3. **Configuration Files**
Please provide:
- Complete `.cursor/mcp.json` configuration template
- Environment variable setup instructions
- Any additional configuration files needed

#### 4. **Troubleshooting Guide**
Include solutions for common issues like:
- "CLICKUP_API_TOKEN environment variable required" errors
- "channel_not_found" Slack errors
- "MCP server not found" issues
- Authentication/permission problems

#### 5. **Testing & Verification**
Show me how to:
- Verify MCP tools are available in Cursor
- Test task creation in ClickUp
- Test message sending to Slack
- Confirm the integration is working properly

### 📝 **Additional Requirements:**

#### **Security Considerations:**
- Best practices for token management
- How to avoid committing sensitive data to git
- Proper environment variable setup

#### **My Use Cases:**
I want to be able to do things like:
- "Create a high-priority bug report task in ClickUp and notify the dev team in Slack"
- "Create a task for code review and send progress updates to project channel"
- "Automatically create tasks from test failures and report them"

#### **My Technical Level:**
- **Programming Experience:** [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced] - *specify your level*
- **API Experience:** [New to APIs/Some experience/Experienced] - *specify your level*
- **Preferred Learning Style:** [Step-by-step/Code examples/Conceptual explanations] - *specify preference*

### 🎯 **Expected Deliverables:**

Please provide:
1. **Setup checklist** with clear steps
2. **Working configuration files** I can copy-paste
3. **Test scripts** to verify everything works
4. **Example usage scenarios** showing real commands
5. **Troubleshooting guide** for common issues
6. **Security best practices** for token management

### ⚠️ **Important Notes:**
- I want to use **MCP tools directly** in Cursor, not just API calls
- Please include **real examples** with placeholder tokens I can replace
- I need this to work reliably for daily use, not just as a demo
- Include **error handling** and **validation** in examples
- Show me how to **extend this setup** for other tools later

### 🔗 **References I'm Aware Of:**
- MCP Documentation: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs
- ClickUp API: https://clickup.com/api
- Slack API: https://api.slack.com/

### ❓ **Specific Questions:**
1. What are the minimum required Slack permissions for MCP integration?
2. How do I find the correct ClickUp List IDs for my workspace?
3. What's the difference between Slack Bot tokens and User tokens for MCP?
4. How do I handle multiple ClickUp workspaces or Slack teams?
5. Can I use environment variables instead of hardcoding tokens in the config?

### 🎯 **Success Criteria:**
I'll know this is working when I can:
- Type a natural language command in Cursor
- See a task created in ClickUp with proper formatting
- Receive a notification in the correct Slack channel
- Do this reliably without errors or manual intervention
