## 📋 **Mandatory Review Process**

### **🔍 Step 1: AI Creates Safe PR**
```
AI generates code → Creates DRAFT PR → Adds safety measures → Requests @merekahira review
```

### **🔍 Step 2: Human Review Required**
```
@merekahira notified → Reviews code line-by-line → Checks security → Verifies logic
```

### **🔍 Step 3: Testing Phase**
```
Deploy to staging → Manual testing → Integration tests → Issue verification
```

### **🔍 Step 4: Approval Process**
```
@merekahira approves → Removes safety labels → Marks ready for review → Final merge
```

### **🔍 Step 5: Post-Deploy Monitoring**
```
Production monitoring → Issue tracking → Rollback ready → Documentation update
```
